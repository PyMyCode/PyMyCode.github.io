<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
- An options contract is an agreement between two parties to facilitate a <b>potential transaction</b> on an underlying security at a preset price, 
referred to as the <b>strike price</b>, prior to or on the <b>expiration date</b>.
<br>- Buying an option offers the <b>right</b>, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell the underlying asset.
<br>- Options generally cost a fraction <b>(premium)</b> of what the underlying shares would
<br>- A standard stock pile consists of 100 shares

<h3>Types</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Call: Right to buy</li>
    <li>Put: Right to sell</li>
</ul>

<br> Example:
<p>
    Apple is trading at $110 at expiry, the option contract strike price is $100, and the options cost the buyer $2 per share, 
    the profit is $110 - ($100 +$2) = $8. If the buyer bought one options contract, their profit equates to $800 ($8 x 100 shares); 
    the profit would be $1,600 if they bought two contracts ($8 x 200).

    Now, if at expiration Apple is trading below $100, obviously the buyer won't exercise the option to buy the shares at $100 a piece, 
    and the option expires worthless. The buyer loses $2 per share, or $200, for each contract they boughtâ€”but that's all. 
    That's the beauty of options: <b>You're only out the premium if you decide not to play</b>
