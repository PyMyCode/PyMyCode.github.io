<h2>Options Contract</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
- An options contract is an agreement between two parties to facilitate a <b>potential transaction</b> on an underlying security at a preset price, 
referred to as the <b>strike price</b>, prior to or on the <b>expiration date</b>.
<br>- Buying an option offers the <b>right</b>, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell the underlying asset.
<br>- Options generally cost a fraction <b>(premium)</b> of what the underlying shares would
<br>- A standard stock pile consists of 100 shares

<h3>Types</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Call: Right to buy</li>
    <li>Put: Right to sell</li>
</ul>
<h3>Positions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Long: To a buy an option</li>
    <li>Short: To sell an option</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. Short Call: To <b>sell</b> the right to buy the underlying asset at a strike price</p>
<p>E.g. Long Put: To <b>buy</b> the right to sell the underlying asset at a strike price</p>

<ul>
    <li>In-The-Money (ITM): Have intrinsic value</li>
    <li>Out-of-The-Money(OTM): No intrinsic value, only time value</li>
    <li>At-the-Money(OTM)</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. ITM for Call = Strike price (100€) < underlying asset (110€).</p>

<h3>The Greeks</h3>
<h4>Delta</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Delta (Δ) = change in option price for a 1$ change in price of underlying asset</li>
    <li>Delta is higher for ITM than for OTM</li>
    <li>0 to 1 for call, -1 to 0 for puts</li>
</ul>
<h4>Gamma</h4>
<ul>
    <li>rate of change for an option's delta based on a single-point move in the delta's price</li>
    <li>Gamma is at its highest when an option is at the money and is at its lowest when it is further away from the money</li>
    <li>Gamma and Omega (Hebel) are almost the same</li>
</ul>
<h4>Theta</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Rate of decline in the value of an option over time (time decay)</li>
    <li>indicates how much the option's value will decline every day up to maturity (negative number for long positions)</li>
    <li>More the number of days to to expiration, lower is the theta</li>
</ul>
<h4>Vega</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Vega is the measurement of an option's price sensitivity to changes in the volatility of the underlying asset</li>
    <li>Vega represents the amount that an option contract's price changes in reaction to a 1% change in the implied volatility of the underlying asset</li>
    <li>implied volatility is the variance of the underlying asset</li>
</ul>
<h4>Call Options</h4>

<br> Example:
<p>
    Apple is trading at $110 at expiry, the option contract strike price is $100, and the options cost the buyer $2 per share, 
    the profit is $110 - ($100 +$2) = $8. If the buyer bought one options contract, their profit equates to $800 ($8 x 100 shares); 
    the profit would be $1,600 if they bought two contracts ($8 x 200).

    Now, if at expiration Apple is trading below $100, obviously the buyer won't exercise the option to buy the shares at $100 a piece, 
    and the option expires worthless. The buyer loses $2 per share, or $200, for each contract they bought—but that's all. 
    That's the beauty of options: <b>You're only out the premium if you decide not to play</b>
