  <li>Staking: Locking 32 ETH as collateral.. network picks you up.. you solve--get rewarded</li>
  <li>Coinbase Yield : 4.01% APY</li>
</ul>
<h3>Working</h3>
When the minimum balance is met, a node deposits that amount of cryptocurrency into the network as a stake (similar to a security deposit).
The size of a stake is directly proportional to the chances of that node being chosen to forge the next block. 
If the node successfully creates a block, the validator receives a reward, similar to how a miner is rewarded in proof-of-work chains. 
Validators lose part of their stake if they double-sign or attempt to attack the network.
